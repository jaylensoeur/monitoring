# Synthetic monitoring
Synthetic monitoring is used to check the availability of a service, automated end-to-end testing is performanced on a regular interval (more frequency on critical paths) 24/7 from the end-user perspective. This form of monitoring is effectively good for services with multiple failure points, especially for services which a heavily reliant on 3rd party services.

# Health checks
Individual point of failures should be health checked. The intent is to identify and diagnosed quickly.
